# Welcome to Customer Onboarding Application

This is where you can start to get familiar with the codebase that we'll work with during our pairing session.
As you will see, it is focused on identifying code smells, refactoring and testing legacy codebase while promoting
conversations.

## Application description
For each new client there is a onboarding process needing, and of course, the process is served within an Web Application.
The current application is a Demo App for viewing the current list of customer which is served by the ClientsListComponent class.

## Technology used

- Node v16+
- NPM 8+
- Angular Framework
- Angular Material

## Before the interview

Get familiar with the codebase! Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
